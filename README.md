Objective:
The project aimed to independently explore and analyze data from the olist_db database to uncover actionable business insights. The focus was to delve into different aspects of the business, particularly payments and monetization, and provide 3-5 key insights to the executive team.

Data Extraction and SQL Queries: Crafted well-documented and logically structured SQL queries to extract relevant data from the company databases. Emphasis was on clarity and efficiency in data retrieval.
Data Analysis & Visualization: Conducted a thorough analysis using Google Sheets and Microsoft Powerpoint. The process involved exploring various angles, even those that did not yield immediate insights, to ensure a comprehensive understanding.
Presentation to Executives: Developed a concise, 10-slide presentation focused on the most significant insights, tailored for a business-oriented audience without a deep background in data analytics or statistics.
Key Insights and Findings:
Provided in-depth analysis of transactional data to understand customer behavior and payment trends.
Utilized geographical data (longitude and latitude) to draw correlations with business performance metrics.
Investigated the application of the Pareto principle in the context of Olist's data, examining its relevance in customer and sales distributions.
Challenges and Further Analysis:
Discussed the limitations of the current data set and analysis techniques.
Recommended further areas of research, integrating industry knowledge and external data sources for a more rounded understanding.
Conclusions:
This project highlights my ability to independently navigate and analyze complex data sets, derive meaningful insights, and present them in an executive-friendly format. It showcases my skills in SQL, data visualization, and strategic business analysis, making it a valuable addition to my professional portfolio.
